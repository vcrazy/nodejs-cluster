nodejs-cluster
==============

This is a nodejs cluster with localhost servers running on redis and socket.io, port 4444.

Before use, please install cluster, redis and socket.io modules and start the redis server.
Then choose a folder in which to run the node server from and start it.
Open socketioindex.html like a normal html page - doubleclick.

Note: If you try to open the html with port 4444 it will not work. This is the server's port and shoud be used only for server's job.
